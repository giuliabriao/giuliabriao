# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=giuliabriao.giuliabriao)

My name is Giulia BriÃ£o, and I am from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· :octocat: 

**I am in a career transition**: from the environmental area, that I graduated, to the technology area. Both areas may seem totally different but they can -and should- strengthen bonds on how one would help another with innovation and improvements for the society.

I discovered myself in the technology area due to the opportunity I found with the **Full Stack Dev Resilia course in 6 months**, the perfect chance to start my career, because now I can learn the main skills that the job market requires and I have open paths to follow ahead with my own legs.

More about me:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, Bootstrap, Rest APIs and Agile Methodologies;
- :raising_hand: In search of a job opportunity;
- âš¡ **Fun fact**: I'm 22, never had a cat, moved to SÃ£o Paulo after my whole life living in Rio and my favorite color is red. *(I'll be updating this from time to time cuz I love fun facts :satisfied:)*
